<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
<P><b>Automatic paper cutting machine-using geneva machine</b></P>
<p>Here we <i>propose</i> the design and <em>fabrication</em> of a fully automated paper cutter based on geneva mechanism. 
Our proposed system cuts paper pieces of equal lengths based on geneva mechanism.System uses a 12V motor in order to drive the entire system.We use a shaft which is directly connected to the motor.This shaft has a connecting rod which is connected to a scissor in order to drive the cutting mechanism for 
cutting paper.This motor shaft is connected to a sprocket which is in turn connected by a chain to another sprocket.This sprocket is now connected to a genava mechanism wheel. This wheel is used to drive paper feed into 
the cutter mechanism.<blockquote>Here we use geneva mechanism driven by another connecting z shape rod.This mechanism ensures paper feed of equal length inserted at proper time intervals. System uses a supporting frame that maintains proper coordination between feed and cutting mechanism</p>
